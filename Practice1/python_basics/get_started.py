#Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
#Let's write our first Python file, called hello.py, which can be done in any text editor:
# hello.py:
print("Hello, Kazakhstan")

#The output should be:
#Hello, World!
